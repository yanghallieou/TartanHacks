# FocusText: an easy tool for quick and efficient reading. 

## Projet description
This project implements Focus Reading to make the reading experience faster and more efficient. The input is formatted to highlight the first half of words. This helps the reader to anchor their focus and read faster. 

The reader can input text via a textbox or directly upload a PDF file. Then the font and the line height can be adjusted using sliders. 

This project presents an easy-to-use webpage to increase reading experience. It is especially useful for students or researchers who need to read large amounts of text. 

## Table of content
- ```index.html```: main html file for the project
- ```style.css```: css styling
- ```scripts.js```: functions to extract text from pdf, update font styles and apply focus reading on the text.
